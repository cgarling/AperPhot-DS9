any new files I make: 
git add <filename>

commit things to be changed pre push
git commit -m "message"

add the repository,
git remote add origin <url>

I set up my remote with the name bitbucket so that

git push bitbucket master
is the correct syntax, or replace master with other branch. use -u to remember the last command. 

you need to add files to the commit, so every time you want to commit you have to use git add, or you can do 
git commit -a -m "message" 
to commit all changed files

now I'll make a new branch called hw1, 
switch into this branch using git checkout <branchname>
